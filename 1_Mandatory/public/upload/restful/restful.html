    <h1>The RESTful API</h1>
    <h4>REST is acronym for <strong>RE</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <string>T</string>ransfer.</h4>
    <h4>REST has it's own 6 guiding constraints, which must be satisfied <br>if an interface needs to be referred as <string>RESTful.</string></h4>
</div>
<div class="restRow">
    <div class="restColumn" ><h4><strong>1. Client-server</strong></h4>
    <p>By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="restColumn"><h4><strong>2 Stateless</strong></h4>
    <p>Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.</p></div>
    <div class="restColumn"><h4><strong>3. Cacheable</strong></h4>
    <p>Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.</p></div>
    <div class="restColumn"><h4><strong>4. Uniform interface</strong></h4>
        <p>By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. In order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints
            are needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state.</p></div>
    <div class="restColumn"><h4><strong>5. Layered system</strong></h4>
        <p>The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior such that each component cannot “see” beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting.</p></div>
    <div class="restColumn"><h4><strong>6. Code on demand</strong></h4>
        <p>REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented.</p></div>

    <h2>The methods of REST</h2>
    <div class="bodyStripe"></div>
    <div class="restRow">
        <div class="restColumn2"><h4>GET</h4>

    <p><h2>The following wil show examples on the methods of REST</h2></p>
    <p><h4><em>Communication between clients and servers on the internet mostly takes place via the HTTP
        protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). This enables a data exchange <br>
        via request and response. When a user retrieves a URL via a client (e.g. their web browser),
        this client sends a request to the server, and the <br>
        server provides an HTML page that is loaded by the user’s browser. The two most commonly used methods to enable this
        kind of communication are GET and POST.</em></h4></p> <br>
    <p><h3><li>Query strings</li></h3></p>
    <p><h4><em>When the GET request method is used, if a client uses the HTTP protocol on a web server to request a certain
    resource, the client sends the server certain GET parameters through the <br>
    requested URL. These parameters are pairs of key and their corresponding values, so-called key-value pairs. These are added to the
    <br>URL with a “?” sign and tell the server which resources are meant. The name and value are always separated using a “=” sign.</em></h4></p>
    <br>
    <p><h4><em>Here is a look at the syntax in the url:</em></h4></p> <br>

    <p><h4><em>The above code can be run and tested right now. Go on, try to type "localhost/rest?q=?hello" in your url. It will take
    <br>you to a blank page with a little text, and your value.</em></h4></p>

    <div class="methodShow">
        <p>Let' try going through a familiar case in this example, to show how the methods of Rest works. I Will be using an old
            <br> code, which i am familiar with, for the sake of understanding.
            First off, lets say we want a "database" of cars.
            In this example we dont use a real database but instead an array of JSON objects, just for the demonstration.
            The Array wil consist of 3 cars from the start, shown in the right side:
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Taking into consideration that the array of cars which we have created is in the form of JSON data. We have to add something
            <br>in the top of our code, to be able to parse JSON date. We do that through express, by notating "app.use(express.json());" and
            <br> "app.use(express.urlencoded());" in the top of our app.js file. <br>
            - If a problem parsing json data still occurs, it could be because of NPM's pre installed bodyparser. <br>
            this can be removed in the terminal by writing "npm uninstall body-parser".
            <br></p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>We are gonna demonstrate 4 of the 5 methods, while PUT and PATCH could be perceived as somewhat of the same method.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h4><li style="margin-left: 2%; text-decoration: underline">GET mapping</li></h4>
        <p>First off we wil look at the get method, and this will be done in two different ways: <br>
        <li style="margin-left: 2%">Get all cars</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 2%">Get a car with a specific id</li>
        <br>The first app.get returns the entire array of cars to the user through the callback function,
            this happens when arriving at the page "/cars". <br>
            - The callback function is explained under the JavaScript page.<br><br>
            The second get request is a get request for a car with a specific id. As seen above the cars have an id and a model.
            <br> The path which is written as: "cars/:id" is a method to receive a request parameter where it in this case, looks for a specific id.
        </p><br><br><br><br>
        <p><h4><li style="margin-left: 2%; text-decoration: underline">POST mapping</li></h4></p>
        <p>The Post mapping seen on the right hand side, continue our car case. <br>
        at first we are going to "console.log(req.body);" so that we can see in our terminal, what is going in. <br>
            then we use the parameters in the req.body to make a new object called "newCar", and as we have seen above, all the cars have an id.
            Since this is just an array and not at database, the id is not auto incremented, this is something we have do ensure ourself. We do that by making a variable
            called "nextCarId" and notate it to be 3, while we already have the first 3 id's in our array.
            then we set the "newCar.id = nextCarId++;", which ensures that the next id of the car is going to be incremented every time a new car is created.
